AOOP practice midterm laboratory activity. (03/27/25)


1. ENCAPSULATION - Bank Account
Create a BankAccount class with:
Private fields: accountNumber, accountHolder, balance
Public methods: Deposit(), Withdraw(), DisplayBalance()
Properties to access account details
Constructor to initialize the account

2. INHERITANCE - Shape
Create a base Shape class and derived classes Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle:
Shape should have abstract methods CalculateArea() and Display()
Each derived class should implement these methods appropriately
Add relevant properties for each shape (radius for Circle, width/height for Rectangle, etc.)

3. POLYMORPHISM - Animal
Create an Animal base class with MakeSound() method and derived classes Dog, Cat, Cow that override this method. Write a program that demonstrates polymorphism by storing different animals in a list and calling MakeSound() on each.

4. ENCAPSULATION - Student
Create a Student class with:
Private fields for name, age, and grade
Public properties with proper validation (e.g., age canâ€™t be negative, grade must be between 0-100)
Method to calculate letter grade based on numeric grade

5. INTERFACE IMPLEMENTATION
Create an IPlayable interface with Play(), Pause(), Stop() methods. Implement this interface in MusicPlayer and VideoPlayer classes with appropriate behaviors.
